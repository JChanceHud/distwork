# Prototype Protocol

A prototype protocol for distributed teams.

## Guidelines

1. When you work on the project take notes. Don't write documentation, don't open issues, just take notes about what you're doing. If someone needed to continue your work after you go to sleep they should be able to get started from your notes. Publish these notes continuously in the form of (for example) one long Notion document (per team member). Distributed organizations have members in all sorts of time zones, one advantage of this should be improved turnaround time as single threaded things (like building a specific feature or fixes) can be done around the clock when needed.
2. Have at least 1 collaborative codebase that all members are a part of. This "main" codebase can be swapped at will, but all members must agree. Many developers working on many different codebases isolates each one. Isolation fosters things like depression and anxiety, both of which are bad, and bad for productivity. The codebase can be something only tangentially related or non-essential (e.g. a block explorer).
    - It's important that developers understand how their teammates work so they can collectively improve their skills and work better together.
3. Have a mixture of developer experience on teams. This forms an implicit chain of command. This chain of command *can* be used for assigning issues, but *should* be used for settling disputes over technical decisions. To clarify: the more experienced members are not implicitly correct, but are more likely to be able to identify and voice problems and ideas. Over time this gives less experienced developers the opportunity to learn from their more experienced peers.
4. Have an agreed upon strategy for distributing work. This can be as loose as "work on X new feature" and as specific as "closing issues with tag X".
5. Be familiar with each others work. Pull request reviews, demoing work in progress software, viewing design documents, etc. Principle #2 is very important for this.
6. Agree upon the work that each team member is doing. A weekly synchronization call can be done like so:
    - ask everyone on the call "what did you do last week?"
    - then once everyone has answered ask "what are you going to do this week?"
    - Participants should offer assistance if they feel they can help with a task. Collaborative codebases are good.
7. Conduct an anonymous survey of the team members each quarter or half. Ask a mediator (that is not a member of the team) to create and administer a survey to the team. The mediator should be well equipped to design and interpret survey results. The mediator should generate a report of their interpretation of the results of the survey. Such results should be provided to the team and used to improve.
8. Participants may contribute up to 20% of their time to organizational projects (see next section) or other Ethereum related, open source, public good projects.
9. Time off should not be requested. Breaks throughout the day or week are fine. Complete disconnection (e.g. a vacation) should be announced to the team.
10. This protocol may be swapped at most once per quarter, by majority vote (ties favor swap).
