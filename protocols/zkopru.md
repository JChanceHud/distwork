# Zkopru Protocol

A distributed work protocol for the Zkopru team.

## Guidelines

1. Team members should allocate time throughout the week to contribute to a collaborative codebase. This should help the team communicate and work better together. To start the collaborative codebase will be the [zkopru core implementation](https://github.com/zkopru-network/zkopru). For more info see [prototype #2](https://github.com/JChanceHud/distwork/blob/main/protocols/prototype.md)
2. TODO: Agree on a strategy for distributing work in the above collaborative codebase.
  - Proposed strategy: assign ownership of packages to team members for maintenance/improvement
3. Team members should be familiar with each others current work. Pull request reviews, demoing work in progress software, viewing design documents, etc. All of these tasks are important for being familiar with the software, even if they don't directly create visible results.
4. Weekly synchronization calls should be done to keep team members aware of each others current work. Calls can be done with the following structure:
    - ask everyone on the call "what did you work on last week?"
    - then once everyone has answered ask "what are you working on this week?"
    - Participants should offer assistance if they feel they can help with a task. Collaborative codebases are good.
5. Time off should not be requested. Breaks throughout the day or week are fine. Complete disconnection (e.g. a vacation) should be announced to the team.
6. OPTIONAL: Take notes as you work so that other team members can understand your tasks in collaborative codebases. Ideally another team member could learn about your work or continue it while you sleep (e.g. for delivering bug patches or similar important features). This can be done in a single long Notion or HackMD document. These notes can be whatever format feels best.
7. This protocol can be updated as desired by a majority vote.
