# Zkopru Protocol

A protocol for the Zkopru team.

## Guidelines

1. Team members should allocate time throughout the week to contribute to a collaborative codebase. This should help the team communicate and work better together. To start the collaborative codebase will be the [zkopru core implementation](https://github.com/zkopru-network/zkopru). For more info see [prototype #2]()
2. Have an agreed upon strategy for distributing work in collaborative codebases. This should be done in the form of assigning issues to oneself. Participants can also write issues they would like to work on.
3. Be familiar with each others work. Pull request reviews, demoing work in progress software, viewing design documents, etc. All of these tasks are important for being familiar with the software, even if they don't directly create visible results.
4. Weekly synchronization calls should be done with the following structure:
    - ask everyone on the call "what did you do last week?"
    - then once everyone has answered ask "what are you going to do this week?"
    - Participants should offer assistance if they feel they can help with a task. Collaborative codebases are good.
5. Time off should not be requested. Breaks throughout the day or week are fine. Complete disconnection (e.g. a vacation) should be announced to the team.
6. OPTIONAL: Take notes as you work so that other team members can understand your tasks in collaborative codebases. Ideally another team member could learn about your work or continue it while you sleep (e.g. for delivering bug patches or similar important features). This can be done in a single long Notion or HackMD document. These notes can be whatever format feels best.
6. The protocol can be updated as desired by a majority vote.
